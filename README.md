# rev-u
An automated resume reviewer that recognizes your potential and gives feedback focused on career impact.

**How it works**

The rev-u backend is built with Python, Flask, scikit-learn, and the cohere API. The frontend is hosted on Firebase and built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bulma. Upon receiving a resume, rev-u runs a classification model to see what career field the resume belongs to. It then generates a personalized prompt to the Cohere text generation API to create a critique.
